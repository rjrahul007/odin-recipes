        <h4>ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 ⅓ cups basmati rice</li>
          <li>1 pound chicken thighs</li>
          <li>¼ cup ghee (clarified butter), divided</li>
          <li>2 onions, thinly sliced</li>
          <li>2 green chile peppers, chopped</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="steps">
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star
            anise, and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until
            coarsely chopped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice,
            ginger-garlic paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and
            turmeric in a large bowl. Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover
            with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator, about 2
            hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves.
            Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially
            cooked through and still firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.
          </li>
          <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.</li>
          <li>
            Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high
            heat. Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15
            minutes. Drain on paper towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2
            bay leaves and chile peppers; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2
            minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee from the pot; set it
            aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add
            to the pot. Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2
            minutes per side. Spread drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top
            of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee and saffron milk over onions and
            rice.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat
            to low and continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and
            let stand, covered, until rice is tender and an instant-read
            thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74
            degrees C), about 15 minutes.
