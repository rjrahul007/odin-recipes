        <h3>Teddy Bear Hot Tub S'Mores</h3>
        <p>
          Mini teddy bears chill out in toasted marshmallow hot tubs filled with
          super-easy chocolate bourbon ganache and edged in graham cracker
          crumbs. If these sassy s'mores don't own your party, you're not having
          enough fun.

        <h4>ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 (4 ounce) bars dark chocolate, broken into pieces, divided</li>
          <li>4 fluid ounces heavy whipping cream</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons bourbon (Optional)</li>
          <li>1 (10 ounce) package regular-size marshmallows</li>
          <li>2 graham crackers, crushed</li>
          <li>36 teddy bear-shaped graham snacks</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="steps">
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place 1/2 of the chocolate pieces in a bowl. Line a baking sheet
            with parchment paper or waxed paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat cream in a small saucepan just until it boils; pour over
            chocolate pieces. Let mixture stand for 1 to 2 minutes. Gently whisk
            until ganache is smooth; whisk in bourbon, a little at a time, until
            smooth. The ganache will thicken as it cools.
          </li>
          <li>
            Insert a fork into 1 end of a marshmallow without pushing it through
            all the way. Toast over a gas or electric burner set to medium-low,
            rotating until all sides are browned and marshmallow is puffed,
            about 1 minute per side. Hold the marshmallow high enough so the
            heat causes the marshmallow to puff up without catching on fire.
            Don't brown the top end where the fork is inserted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place marshmallow on the prepared baking sheet, using a second fork
            to help slide the marshmallow off the fork. After a few seconds, the
            untoasted top will sink down, forming a hollow space in the center
            of the marshmallow. Repeat with the rest of the marshmallows. Chill
            in the refrigerator for 10 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Melt the remaining chocolate pieces in a microwave-safe glass or
            ceramic bowl in 15-second intervals, stirring after each melting, 1
            to 2 minutes. Stir chocolate until smooth; cool slightly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread melted chocolate onto top and bottom of each marshmallow and
            dip into the crushed graham crackers. Chill in refrigerator for 10
            minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whisk the cooled ganache until fluffy; pipe into each marshmallow
            using a pastry bag or plastic bag with a corner cut off. Garnish
            each "hot tub" with a teddy bear-shaped graham snack.
